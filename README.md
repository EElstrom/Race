# Race
A fun simulation of the tortoise and hare racing story.

A quick and easy play on the old nursery story of the tortoise and the hare, whom race based on different ideas of how to best achieve their goals. The program was originally an assignment that mostly displayed a functional output to user and effective uses of arrays for frequencies. The two runners are actively printed out for each attempt to race forward, and will occassionally collide.

The program utilizes a time function (to briefly pause), which is based on the system that is running it, and may differ across other platforms. 

A perfectly fun way to make ludicrous bets that are only slightly biased towards the tortoise. Slightly. Maybe a lot.

For Portfolio use.
